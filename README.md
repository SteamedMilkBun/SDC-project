# MCSPA-2312A SDC Project


### Description
This system design capstone (SDC) project implements Redis caching to the previous front-end capstone project.

Software optimization is an integral aspect of system design, and caching is one of many techniques towards optimization. This project aims to focus on a the common bottleneck that exists between the back-end server and the back-end database. Differences in speed for a cache miss and a cache hit are demonstrated in the SDC Video mp4 file.
